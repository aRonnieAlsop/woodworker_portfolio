            <p>With over two decades of experience in the wood flooring industry, Polly has established himself as a trusted and skilled flooring contractor. Since 1999, he has been transforming homes and businesses with exceptional wood floor installations, sanding, refinishing, and restoration work.

Polly’s journey into wood flooring began long before his Fine Arts degree, which he earned later in his career as a visual artist. This background has provided him with a unique perspective and an exceptional eye for detail, qualities that have enhanced his craft in the flooring industry.

In 2017, Polly decided to take his years of experience and expertise to the next level by launching his own flooring business. Since then, he has been serving both commercial and residential clients, specializing in custom inlays, intricate border work, and the restoration of wood floors that are over 100 years old. He has an incredible knack for reviving and preserving these timeless pieces of history, breathing new life into them while maintaining their original charm.

Polly is also highly skilled in floating floor systems and has extensive experience in general construction and project management. However, his true passion lies in working with wood—whether it’s creating custom designs, restoring worn floors, or installing new ones to perfection.

No matter the project, Polly brings a level of dedication, craftsmanship, and professionalism that ensures his clients are always thrilled with the final result.</p>
