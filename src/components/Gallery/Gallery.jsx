                            Polly was the sole craftsman responsible for the stunning wood flooring throughout the historic three-story Thatcher Hotel. He preserved century-old wood flooring in the library, stairs, ballroom, and select spaces while seamlessly integrating new flooring in guest rooms and additional areas. His artistry ensures that the newly laid floors will age as gracefully as the preserved originalsâ€”lasting for generations and maintaining the integrity of this beautifully restored landmark.
